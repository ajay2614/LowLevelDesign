/**
 *
 * 1. The Facade Pattern provides a simplified class to a complex system of classes.
 * It acts like a front desk, handling all the internal complexities so the user doesn't have to interact
 * with the subsystems directly.
 *
 * 2. The facade class holds an instance (or instances) of the actual complex classes and combines or
 * normalizes multiple operations into simpler methods. This allows the user to perform tasks
 * through user-friendly methods that may internally involve 2â€“3 underlying operations.
